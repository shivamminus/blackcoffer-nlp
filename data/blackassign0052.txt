Data ScienceAnalyticsArtificial IntelligenceBig DataBlackcofferWhat ThinkMachine Learning difference Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Statistics, Data Mining? Ajay Bidyarthy - March 9, 2021 14493 “Data oil” important trendline 21st century. reason advancements fields related data analysis. field AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining deal data developing staggering pace, fields popular buzzwords days. Buzzwords originated technical terms underlying essence fashionable impress. main reason misconception people. AI, ML, Stats, Data Mining, fields related analysis data mistook thing, words interchangeably convey thing. true all! similarity disciplines disciplines related analysis data converting data “information”. academics, learning AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining, academic approach wander technical definitions concepts underlying essence aim discipline remain unexplored, case articles explain difference. Thus, primary confusion learners. Hence, article explains difference explaining philosophy aims disciplines wandering technical definitions. difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining? essential difference disciplines lies “aims” approach achieve aims. aims fields explained detail sections: Artificial Intelligence: aim Artificial intelligence understand intelligent entities. satisfy aim, understand intelligence makes agent intelligent agent? answer questions found studying intelligent agents intelligent agent found standing front mirror! Yes! Humans examples intelligent entities. Thus, 1900s, researchers began exploring thought process, reasoning process humans human beings considered ideal intelligent agent. Mimicking human behavior aim AI initial years research. setting goal, studies experiments began famous experiment conducted initial years achieve aim Turing Test! Turing defined intelligent behavior ability achieve human-level performance cognitive tasks, sufficient fool interrogator. test received criticism mimicking human behavior intelligence. intelligence related working human brain human brain, intelligence meaning! Thus, mimicking human thought processes reasoning transformed aim. field Psychology philosophy resonate aim understand human thought process. difference AI understand thought process mimic it, build it. collaboration fields resulted models Neural Networks mimic function neurons present human brain. So, basically, initial aim human-centered humans considered ideal intelligent agent. Concurrently, field computer science developing greater pace. advances computer science, experiments theories easily tested validated. programs applied solve real-life problems, found computers performed humans tasks complex humans. examples chess-playing program. AI program defeated world’s chess player Garry Kasparov. incident human intelligence ultimate intelligence human defeat AI program. leads question, human intelligence ideal intelligence? computers advanced, proved humans complex tasks. definition intelligence related ability solve cognitive tasks problems. So, nature agents, researchers began study nature intelligence itself. question test validate intelligence? test intelligence solve cognitive problems. agent intelligent solve complex problem. problem-solving approach easily tested validated computers. Thus, researchers began studying ideal intelligence, selected agent validate experiments computer. So, computer problem-solving approach adopted. So, human-centered approach computer, problem-solving approach main aims AI. fields contributed field giving valuable insights. aims important collaboratively form main aim AI! Machine Learning: problem-solving approach, big challenge AI overcome order achieve aim. solving math problem. cases intelligence tested problem-solving approach. math problems solve. problem familiar problem not. problem. problem familiar you, means solve kind problems solved similar problems past. So, question, mind solve problem? answer is, solved similar problems past, learned past data, solve problems, haven’t problem past, solve similar problems. form intelligence. case problem solved kind problems past. solve problem, consciously gather manipulate information reach conclusion. kind approach necessarily rely past data completely reasoning process. kind intelligence. AI build intelligent agents, kinds intelligence developed agent. But, reality AI reached point build agents learn past data find information. AI today reached point build agents own. type intelligence. So, AI implement type intelligence Machine Learning! So, domain AI focuses solely implementing kind intelligence fact Machine Learning. reason ML called subset AI! So, main difference AI ML. Technically speaking, “It field study computers ability learn past data find meaningful conclusions, patterns explicitly programmed”. statement elaboration. essence ML related process “Generalization” learning past data. Generalization abstraction common properties specific instances formulated general concepts claims. humans recognize daily life objects. animal, easily recognize “dog” “cat”. trivial task wondered mind it? answer Generalization! picture dog, easily recognize picture dog, because, minds abstracted description dog formulated “concept” dog concepts learned past experiences dog. So, dependent fact things represented generalized concepts minds. generalization only, real “information”. So, give computers ability generalize “raw data” convert “information” patterns trends data own. Statistics: discipline concerns collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, presentation data. Statistics deal data aim explain it. So, study explaining data itself! Statistics main domains Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics deals explanation description data “Descriptive” statistics. explain information possible, easily large data complex task otherwise. Inferential statistics make accurate inferences small data. inference tasks daily lives. simple case cooking soup. completing recipe, taste small sample, is, spoonful soup check soup tastes good bad. Depending result sample, make inference soup soup whole, good bad. Similarly, statistics, cases apply inference meaningful information. example, case gather data time-consuming costly. cases, applying inference based sample introduces uncertainty. inferential statistics help. So, data context uncertainty decision-making face uncertainty statistics deals with. So, however, data, statistics explain data. aim resonate AI ML, statistics fields correctly interpret data! Data Mining: “Data”, raw form. examples sensors industrial applications. sensors manufacturing plant sense properties temperature, pressure, etc. raw data generated sensors converted suitable form, processed, analyzed gather valuable insights, solve problem! Due unique aim capturing essence large datasets, gather insights, Data Mining referred “Knowledge Discovery”. why, Carly Fiorina, CEO Hewlett-Packard said, “The goal turn data information information Insight”. statement completely explains aim Data Mining! So, difference AI Machine Learning Statistics Data Mining lies aims. approaches fields, fulfilling aims fields. beauty fields!
