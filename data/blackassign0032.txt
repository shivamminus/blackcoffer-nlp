Let’s understand Artificial Intelligence – Artificial Intelligence AI basically machines displaying intelligence. machine playing chess robot answering questions Facebook. Artificial Intelligence broken types. AIs designed specific tasks, detecting specific type cancer. However, AIs multiple tasks, driving car. types AIs. top, important fields Machine Learning ML, Neural Network, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing NLP. Machine Learning idea machines prove similar human learns skill. Machine Learning optimization existing skill. Machine Learning fields application entertainment. Netflix Machine Learning recommend shows watch based shows seen. Neural Networks algorithms modeled human brain. algorithms give similar results human give. Artificial Neural Networks medical fields diagnose cancers lung cancer prostate cancer. Computer Vision idea computers visions. things human beings potentially human beings do, depending programming, camera used, etc. Computer Vision autonomous vehicles navigation place another. Natural Language Processing idea computers listen say. Siri. Siri listen demands, process means, provide answer based researched. AI do, Let’s talk issue. MACHINE REPLACE HUMAN FUTURE WORK? AIs automation jobs, replacing humans do. means job loss concentration wealth selected people. destabilization society social unrest. addition social unrest, AI improves time. means smarter, faster, cheaper implement repetitive things humans do, preparing fast food. predicted AI improve 50 100 years AI super intelligent. means smarter intelligent human earth. experts Elon Musk, end human civilization.

AI solutions expensive tests standards implement. takes time AI improve. example, Boston Dynamics, world’s top robotics company robot 2009 needed assistance walk. Fast forward 2019, robot walk jump objects, backflips more. addition timing, takes time price technological solution drop point affordable. example, desktop computer costs $1000 1999 significantly powerful laptop exact price. AI curve. 10 30 years? AI make human intelligence obsolete? Maybe. proven earlier AI faster cheaper. happens, companies AI technology automate jobs save money, increase productivity, importantly, stay competitive. demonstrated, AI repetition machine learning. difference AI learn faster time progresses due amount data today. learn machines similar machines learn optimize tasks important skills.
