AI advanced technology human can’t remain workforce other, technology produce accurate top-notch results requires make delivery.e.g., firm, AI-based system produces results based historical data analyze communicate present data respective stakeholders inside organization. artificial intelligence technology day-to-day functions interactions humans are: ChatbotsEmail curationA.I. powered advertisingAutomated image recognitionSelf-sufficient drivingVoice activation more. figure represents ‘Artificial Intelligence’ represents ‘Humans’ Artificial intelligence works algorithms, neural networks, deep learning analytical tools AI taking analytical decisions based data provided. Whereas, humans hand higher-level decisions based ‘Intuition’ sometimes, refers gut feeling generates humans situation challenge. AI can’t work handle critical situations humans reciprocate share information stakeholders, humans can’t anticipate accurate fast-paced analytical solutions problems persisting place situation. strength humans AI working synergy surprisingly beneficial advantageous organizations.
